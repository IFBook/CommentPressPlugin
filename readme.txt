Commentpress allows readers to comment paragraph by paragraph in the margins of a text. You can use it to annotate, gloss, workshop, debate and more!

== Description ==

Commentpress is an open source theme and plugin for WordPress that allows readers to comment paragraph by paragraph in the margins of a text. Annotate, gloss, workshop, debate: with Commentpress you can do all of these things on a finer-grained level, turning a document into a conversation. It can be applied to a fixed document (paper/essay/book etc.) or to a running blog.

Please note: this plugin only works with the official [Commentpress Theme](https://github.com/IFBook/CommentPressTheme).

For Wordpress Multisite: do not network activate this plugin. Consider using [Commentpress for Multisite](https://github.com/IFBook/CommentPressMultisite), which will handle the setup of sub-blogs for you.
